Run using:
python trains.py

THIS WILL RUN ITERATIVE DEEPENING ON ALL YARDS (AKA THIS WILL NOT FINISH BECAUSE YARD 1 IS BIG)

To test problems 1-3, use:
python trains.py --test_actions

To run a program on certain default yards use:
python trains.py --yards 3 4 5

To run using A*, use:
python trains.py --search_method A*

Don't use --search_method A* if you want to use iterative deepening

To run using A* on certain yards:
python trains.py --search_method A* --yards 1 3 5

To run iter deep on a custom yard, use:
python trains.py --custom ./test_yards/yard_5

To run A* on a custom yard, use:
python trains.py --search_method A* --custom ./test_yards/yard_5

Check the test_yards folder for examples on how to input your custom yards.
